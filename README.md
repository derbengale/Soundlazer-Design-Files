# Soundlazer Design Files
 Mirror of the design files for the Soundlazer device
This is a mirror of the original design files of the Soundlazer device created by Richard Haberkern. The copyright of the files belong to him. As they were previously open-source and the original website does not exist anymore, i felt free to share them here in case anybody needs the files.

The firmware of the device is for Sigma Studio and can be transferred to the device using this cable: Analog Devices Inc. EVAL-ADUSB2EBUZ 

I found the files on archive.org:
